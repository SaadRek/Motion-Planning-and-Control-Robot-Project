# Optimal route planning and control of a mobile manipulator for material handling in construction

This project focuses on managing material handling for bricklayers on a construction site using a mobile manipulator robot. 
The robot autonomously handles materials, navigates safely around human workers, and follows an optimal path to complete its tasks efficiently. 
To achieve this, the project develops a control system to avoid obstacles and optimizes the robot's route. Work on both simulations and real-world
implementation using the Kuka YouBot robot,
applying skills in control, optimization, and programming (Matlab, C++, Coppelia Simulation)
